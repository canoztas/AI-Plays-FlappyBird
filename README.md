# AI-Plays-FlappyBird



![](https://github.com/canoztas/pyGame-FlappyBird/blob/master/assets/img/kurba.png) I created a flappy bird game with pyGame -> [playable source code here]https://github.com/canoztas/pyGame-FlappyBird  ![](https://github.com/canoztas/pyGame-FlappyBird/blob/master/assets/img/kurba.png)

Then, I used genetic algorithm and neural network to let it play itself. It takes 3 input and uses sigmoid to decide whether it will jump or not. (can be improved)
